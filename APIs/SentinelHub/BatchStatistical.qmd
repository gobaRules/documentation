title: Batch Statistical API
---

**The Batch Statistical API is in beta release. It might misbehave in
case of large requests. We may change the interface, although no major
changes are expected. If you have suggestions for improvements or any
feedback, please share your thoughts on our
[forum](https://forum.sentinel-hub.com/){target="_blank"}.
`<br/>`{=html}The Batch statistical API is only available for enterprise
users. If you don\'t have an enterprise account, and would like to try
it out,
`<a href="mailto:info@sentinel-hub.com?subject=Sentinel Hub Inquiry">`{=html}contact
us`</a>`{=html} for a custom offer.**

The Batch Statistical API (or shortly \"Batch Stats API\") enables you
to request statistics similarly as with the [Statistical
API](/APIs/SentinelHub/Statistical.qmd) but for multiple polygons at
once and/or for longer aggregations. A typical use case would be
calculating statistics for all parcels in a country.

Similarly to the [Batch Processing API](/APIs/SentinelHub/Batch.qmd),
this is an asynchronous REST service. This means that data will not be
immediately returned in the response of the request but delivered to
your object storage, which needs to be specified in the request (e.g. S3
bucket, see [AWS bucket access](#aws-bucket-access) below).

You can find more details about the API in the [API
Reference](/APIs/SentinelHub/ApiReference.qmd#tag/batch-statistical) or
in the [examples](/APIs/SentinelHub/BatchStatistical/Examples.qmd) of
the workflow.

## Workflow

The Batch statistical API workflow in many ways resembles the [Batch
Processing API workflow](/APIs/SentinelHub/Batch.qmd#workflow).
Available actions and statuses are:

-   user\'s actions `ANALYSE`, `START` and `STOP`.
-   request\'s statuses `CREATED`, `ANALYSING`, `ANALYSIS_DONE`,
    `STOPPED`, `PROCESSING`, `DONE`, and `FAILED`.

The Batch statistical API comes with a set of REST actions that support
the execution of various steps in the workflow. The diagram below shows
all possible statuses of the batch statistical request and users\'
actions which trigger transitions among them.

``` {mermaid}
stateDiagram
    [*]-->CREATED
    CREATED-->ANALYSING: #128100; START/ANALYSE
    state fork_state_analysis <<fork>>
    ANALYSING --> fork_state_analysis
    fork_state_analysis --> FAILED
    fork_state_analysis --> ANALYSIS_DONE
    state fork_state_analysis_done <<fork>>
    ANALYSIS_DONE-->fork_state_analysis_done
    fork_state_analysis_done-->PROCESSING: #128100; START
    PROCESSING--> STOPPED: #128100; STOP
    fork_state_analysis_done--> STOPPED: #128100; STOP
    PROCESSING--> DONE
    STOPPED --> ANALYSIS_DONE: #128100; START
    DONE-->[*]
    FAILED-->[*]
```

The workflow starts when a user posts a new batch statistical request.
In this step the system:

-   creates a new batch statistical request with status `CREATED`,
-   validates the user\'s input (not the evalscript),
-   returns the overview of the created request.

The user can then decide to either request an additional analysis of the
request or start the processing. When an additional analysis is
requested:

-   the status of the request changes to `ANALYSING`,
-   the evalscript is validated,
-   After the analysis is finished the status of the request changes to
    `ANALYSIS_DONE`.

If the user chooses to directly start processing, the system still
executes the analysis but when the analysis is done it automatically
starts with processing. This is not explicitly shown in the diagram in
order to keep it simple.

When the user starts the processing:

-   the status of the request changes to `PROCESSING` (this may take a
    while),
-   the processing starts,
-   spent processing units are billed periodically.

When the processing finishes, the status of the request changes to
`DONE`.

#### Stopping the request

A user may stop the request in following states: `ANALYSING`,
`ANALYSIS_DONE` and `PROCESSING`. However:

-   if the status is `ANALYSING`, the analysis will complete,
-   if the status is `PROCESSING`, all features (polygons) that have
    been processed or are being processed at that moment are charged
    for,
-   user is not allowed to restart the request in the next 30 minutes.

#### Processing unit costs

To be able to create, analyse or start a request the user has to have at
least `1000` processing units available in their account. If available
processing units of a user drop below `1000` while request is being
processed the request is automatically stopped and cannot be restarted
in the next 60 minutes. Therefore it is highly recommended to start a
request with a sufficient reserve.

More information about batch statistical costs is available
[here](/APIs/SentinelHub/Overview/ProcessingUnit.qmd#batch-statistical-api).

#### Automatic deletion of stale data

Stale (inactive) requests will be deleted after a certain period of
inactivity, depending on their status:

-   requests with status `CREATED` are deleted after 7 days of
    inactivity
-   requests with status `FAILED` are deleted after 15 days of
    inactivity
-   all other requests are deleted after 30 days of inactivity.

Note that only such requests themselves will be deleted, while the
requests\' result (created statistics) will remain under your control in
your S3 bucket.

## Input polygons as GeoPackage file

The Batch Statistical API accepts a [GeoPackage
file](https://www.geopackage.org/){target="_blank"} containing features
(polygons) as an input. The GeoPackage must be stored in your object
storage (e.g. AWS S3 bucket) and Sentinel Hub must be able to read from
the storage (find more details about this in the [bucket
access](#aws-bucket-access) section below). In a batch statistical
request, the input GeoPackage is specified by setting the path to the
`.gpkg` file in the `input.features.s3` parameter.

All features (polygons) in an input GeoPackage must be in the same CRS
[supported by Sentinel Hub](/APIs/SentinelHub/Process/Crs.qmd). An
example of a GeoPackage file can be downloaded
[here](/APIs/SentinelHub/BatchStatistical/resources/gpkg/geopackage-example.gpkg).

## Evalscript and Batch statistical API

The same specifics as described for [evalscript and Statistical
API](/APIs/SentinelHub/Statistical.qmd#statistical-api-and-evalscript)
apply also for Batch statistical API.

Evalscripts smaller than 32KB in size can be provided directly in a
batch statistical request under `evalscript` parameter. If your
evalsript exceeds this limit, you can store it to your S3 bucket and
provide a reference to it in a batch statistical request under
`evalscriptReference` parameter.

## Processing results

Outputs of a Batch Statistical API request are `json` files stored in
your object storage. Each `.json` file will contain requested statistics
for one feature (polygon) in the provided GeoPackage. You can connect
statistics in a json file with corresponding feature (polygon) in the
GeoPackge based on:

-   `id` of a feature from GeoPackage is used as name of json file (e.g.
    `1.json`, `2.json`) and available in the json file as `id` property
    OR
-   a custom column `identifier` of type string can be added to
    GeoPackage and its value will be available in json file as
    `identifier` property.

The outputs will be stored in the bucket and the folder specified by
`output.s3.path` parameter of the batch statistical request. The outputs
will be available in a sub-folder named after the ID of your request
(e.g.
`s3://<my-bucket>/<my-folder>/db7de265-dfd4-4dc0-bc82-74866078a5ce`).
